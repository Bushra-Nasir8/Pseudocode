...........Problem.............
Develop an algorithm that allows a taxi company to calculate how much a taxi fare
should be. The algorithm should:
a. Prompt the user to enter the journey distance in kilometers.
i. The distance entered must be greater than zero.
ii. The user should be made to re-enter the distance until the distance
entered is valid.

b. Prompt the user to enter the number of passengers (max 4 passengers are
allowed). Re-enter passengers if > 4.
c. Calculate the taxi fare by:
i. Charging Rs. 100 for every passenger regardless of the distance
ii. Charging a further Rs 50 for every kilometer regardless of how many
passengers there are.
d. Output the final taxi fare.
..........Solution............
BEGIN

	VAR Dist
	VAR Passenger
	VAR Fare
	
	PRINT "Enter the journey distance cover in kilometers."
	INPUT Dist
	
	PRINT "Enter the no of passanger Travel in the taxi"
	INPUT Passenger
	
	WHILE Dist < 0 AND NOT(Passenger <=4 AND Passenger > 0)  DO:
	
	
		PRINT "Re-enter the distance you cover"
		PRINT "Re-enter the No of passenger"
		PRINT "Enter the journey distance cover in kilometers."
		INPUT Dist
	
		PRINT "Enter the no of passanger Travel in the taxi"
		INPUT Passenger
	
	ENDWHILE
	
		Dist = Dist * 50
		Passenger = passenger * 100
		Fare = Dist + Passenger
		PRINT " The fare for the taxi ride is:"
		PRINT Fare
END
