....Problem......
Develop an algorithm that helps an ice cream seller in a hot country predict how
many ice creams they are likely to sell on a particular day. Your algorithm should:
a. Get the user to enter whether it is the weekend or a weekday.
b. Get the user to enter the temperature forecast in degrees Celsius (they
should enter a number between 20 and 45 inclusive; if the number falls
outside of this range then they should be made to re-enter another number
until they enter a valid temperature).
Calculate the number of ice creams that are likely to be sold using the following
information:
c. 100 ice creams are likely to be sold if the temperature is between 20 and 30
degrees inclusive.
d. 150 ice creams are likely to be sold if the temperature is between 31 and 38
degrees inclusive.
e. 120 ice creams are likely to be sold if the temperature is higher than 38
degrees.
f. Double the estimate if it is a weekend.
The output of your algorithm is the estimated number of ice creams that are likely to
be sold.
....Solution.......

	VAR is_weekday
	VAR Temperature
	VAR Salesvolume
	
	PRINT "Enter the week day either weekday or weekend y/n"

	INPUT Temperature
	
	WHILE Temperature < 20 OR Temperature > 45 DO:
	
		PRINT "invalid Input"
		PRINT "Enter the tommorrow forcast  temperature between 20-45 in degree celisus"
		INPUT Temperature
	
	ENDWHILE
	
	IF 
		
		Temperature >= 20 AND Temperature <= 30 DO:
		Salesvolume = 100
		ELSE IF Temperature>= 31 AND Temperature<= 38 DO:
