......Problem..........

You are designing a program that determines if a person is eligible to apply for a
driving license or not based on their age. The main program contains an ‘if’ block that
prints “Eligible” or “Not Eligible” according to the person’s age. The test statement
uses a function called ‘isAdult()’ that takes the age of a person as its parameter and
returns ‘True’ if the person’s age is greater than or equal to 18, and ‘False’ otherwise.
Call your function inside your main program’s ‘if’ block’s test statement to determine
which block (i.e., ‘if’ or ‘else’) should be executed.

......Solution.........

FUNCTION isAdult(age):

	IF age > = 18 DO:
	
		VAR Output 
		Output = "True"
		RETURN Output
	
	ELSE DO:
	
		VAR Output 
		Output = "False"
		RETURN Output

	
	ENDIF 
	
ENDFUNCTION

BEGIN

	VAR age
	VAR Criteria
	
	Print "Enter your age"
	INPUT age
    
	Criteria = CALL isAdult(age)
	
    If  Criteria == "True" DO:
	
        Print "Eligible for driving license"
		
    Else DO:
	
        Print "Not Eligible for driving license"
		
	ENDIF
END
