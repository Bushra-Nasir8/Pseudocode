.......Problem.........
You are designing a simple invoice generator that calculates the total final bill to be
charged to a customer based on their purchases.
The system recognizes each product using a 9 digit product ID that is also printed in
its bar-code. These 9 digits will manually be entered by the cashier using a typing pad
because bar-code scanners have not been installed yet.
There are 5 products currently in store. Their bar-codes are:
a. 789920429 - Sliced Bread (Rs. 160)
b. 627222732 - Cookies (Rs. 20)
c. 212443277 - Shoe Polish (Rs. 225)
d. 857423893 - Frozen Burger Patties (Rs. 1600)
e. 224166527 - Laundry Detergent (Rs. 2000)
Design an algorithm that allows the cashier to add the products in a customer's

shopping basket to the invoice. The cashier will enter the 9 digit product ID one-by-
one. When the cashier enters the product ID, he/she will also enter the quantity of

the product being sold. Every time a product and its quantity are added to the
invoice, the system prompts the cashier to check if there are any more products.
Depending on the answer, the system either adds more products or proceeds to
calculate the final bill.
..........Solution...........
BEGIN
	
	VAR bar_code
	VAR Quantity
	INIT Output = 1
	INIT TOTAL = 0

	WHILE  Output == 1 DO:
	
		INPUT bar_code
		INPUT Quantity
	
		IF bar_code == 789920429 DO:
		
			TOTAL = TOTAL + 160 * Quantity
			
		 ELSE IF bar_code == 627222732 DO:
		 
			TOTAL = TOTAL + 20 * Quantity
			
		 ELSE IF bar_code == 212443277 DO:
			
			TOTAL = TOTAL + 225 * Quantity
			
		 ELSE IF bar_code == 857423893 DO:
			
			TOTAL = TOTAL + 1600 * Quantity
			
		 ELSE IF bar_code == 224166527 DO:
		 
			TOTAL = TOTAL + 2000 * Quantity
			
		ELSE
		
			PRINT "Ivalid bar code; re-ente the barcode"
		
		ENDIF
		
		PRINT "Do you want to enter the other product  enter 1 for yes or 0 for no"
		INPUT Output 
	
	ENDWHILE
		PRINT " Total amount to pay is:"
		PRINT TOTAL
END
